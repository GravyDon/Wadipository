#### 1. General Overview

HELLO! This is a repository of all things Wadiwaya! Currently, it is a work in progress and there remains a lot to do both in terms of presentation and the adding of content. 

##### Relevant components: 
- [[Wadiwayan Concept Map.canvas|Wadiwayan Concept Map]] - Concept map; starting at the middle node, nodes branch out based on whether they coincide with one of the following categories: geography, art, linguistics, history, beliefs/philosophy, or unimplemented suggestions.
- [[Change log]] - List of changes to the Wadipository.
- [[Online Root Node]] - Meant for the online implementation as an alternative, main document for navigating the repository from a high level.
- Contributor Notes - There are currently 14 contributor notes and one contributor folder. These notes/folders contain the main content of the repository. 
	- [[Alfred Contributions]], [[Ataru Contributions]], [[Augustine Contributions]], [[Baku Contributions]], [[Breton Aeronaut Contributions]], [[Collective Contributions]], [[Dr. Zodrom Contributions]], [[Isperikh Don Contributions]], [[Lakapati Contributions]], [[Maryam Contributions]], [[Milo Contributions]], [[Obi Contributions]], [[Pu Gen'Ori Contributions]], [[Sleepy Nuggz Contributions]], and Gravy Contributions (folder)
- Misc files
	- [[Unimplemented Suggestions]] - List of scraped suggestions that haven't been made into a substantial contribution towards the Wadiwayan culture.
	- [[Divination Tradition]] - Document detailing major details on the divination tradition within Wadiwayan culture. Currently being worked on by multiple contributors.

**If you have any questions, direct them towards @Gravy in the Wadiwaya discord, and he will try to get back to you ASAP!**

#### 2. Navigating the Repository
Depending on your usage case, there are different methods to either find specific content, general categories of content, or content from particular sources:

- *For finding categories of content,* simply navigate towards the [[Wadiwayan Concept Map.canvas|Wadiwayan Concept Map]] and scroll around! 
  
  Sub categories split off from there with links looking like [this](https://google.com). Links can lead to URL's, notes, or internal links.

- *For finding content from particular sources,* navigate to the folder labeled "contributors". Sources are designated by who uploaded the content into the Wadiwaya discord/honor rules. **If you have a dispute on any post, please @Gravy in discord**

- *For finding specific content, based on search terms, tags, etc.,* it is possible to use a built in search feature within obsidian. Simply observe the top left of the Obsidian UI, look for the magnifying glass, and start typing! 

Otherwise, navigate to the [[Change log]] to find a list of all added content after V0.1.1 ... Good luck!

#### 3. Guide to Contributing
Currently, the capability to contribute to the vault is limited. However, future implementations will allow for Realtime integration with your own branch via the Github integration. Even though any changes you make as of V0.2.0 aren't easily integrated without @Gravy's intervention, suggestions are always welcome!

Although, if you are particularly motivated, more documentation on the in-game achievements of Wadiwaya is needed. Furthermore, plans to include entries for Banua'hari, for the purpose of making syncresis easier, are being considered. 

Github Repository: WIP
