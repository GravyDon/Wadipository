- 11/18/2024 From "Her Coconutress" (Lakapati): "we need to have weird military traditions, that would be a lot of fun :0"
	Potential rituals:
	- 11/19/2024 From "Masq": "A ritual where new army members gotta shave themselves bald and bury their hair into the jungle's soil. Meant to symbolize the new recruits sacrifice to serve their society the same way their hair will be used as fertilizer to help the ecosystem, becoming a part of the system." 
	  or "JK though head hair could probably be substituted with something that can grow back, like nail clippings from your hand or smth."
	- 11/19/2024 from "PuGen'Ori": "Get burried in mud for days as an initiation. (Similar to making that red egg or whatever it's called in English) and yes. Military usually have their new recruits shave their heads. Literal eggs"


- 11/21/2024 From "Sussy Baka" (Gavin): TLDR: Create a skin based on the Moro Rebels
   "This ([the Moro Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moro_Rebellion)) was a filipino rebellion against the US that was fought for 11 years", "It heavily influenced US tactics, and is the reason why the US military uses shotguns, and has used them so commonly since the rebellion", "The Moro warriors would wrap their limbs tightly before battle to prevent blood loss when they were inevitably shot, and would suicidally attack US troops with spears and swords, often taking out many before finally succumbing to wounds", "**Y'all should create a skin based on the Moro warriors, it would certainly be unique, and fit with the SEA theme of Wadiwaya**", "And also give homage to the rebels" 
   
- 11/01/2024 From "Lore Mistress Baku": we should have a polish orthography for Wadiwayan
  
- 11/01/2024 From "Her Coconutress" (Lakapati): "we should make a *forum* with references (in reference to linguistic texts for polyglots)" Partially implemented by Maryam; emphasis added. 

-  11/13/2024 From "Taisei": "imagine making folklore using wadiwayan"

Ataru (over voice): Make a storm/weather Wadi
