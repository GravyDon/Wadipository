## Name: 

#translation for "false shepherd"

#### Description

8-9 foot tall, lithe figure whose head resembles a carven mask (perhaps a special name or particular type of mask) with mangrove leaves growing from the top. While usually submerged within the mist to the point where no other features can be discerned besides their looming figure, there have been reports of those fortunate enough to resist its hypnotic presence (via the #dispelling effect of burning mangrove bark) of the skin having a texture and color reminiscent of mangrove bark. More notably, two hollowed-out crevices within the mask resemble eyes; no eyes or any noticeable organic features, including a mouth, nose, ears, or eyeballs, are present on the mask. 

#### Relation to Wadiwayan lore 

Once the wadi known as the "dancer on the wind" ( #translation please), whose elemental form was ephemeral and beautiful, betrayed the cycle of life and death by pursuing an undying canopy of mangrove leaves. You see, \____ loved the forests of Wadiwaya for their muse was the shape and curvature of the great many tree canopies, shrubs, and boughs through which \____ could create an endless weave of wind song. 

However, over time \____ became obsessed with the sounds of the mangroves. Their canopies, their roots, and how they twisted above the drumskin of the water intoxicated the wind spirit. As such, the wind spirit could be found prancing about the mangroves in stupendous glee; legends say that the mangrove trees could be seen swaying and dancing to their sounds with branches swaying in circles, leaves twisting in the air, and the water rippling at seemingly nothing at all.

But, the spirit grew dissatisfied with the ecological balance of Wadiwaya. Storms would come and damage or destroy sections of the mangrove forest. Worse still, people would come and harvest the mangroves that the spirit particularly loved to play on. One instance of this resulted in a woodsman going missing for 8 days, and returning insane remarking that the wind spoke to him and spoke that his wife slept around and that his family all whispered on the air how much he hated his lack of compassion. He was also naked, but no one was able to ascertain why before he killed his whole family and himself after returning. 

While this was quite the violation of the wind spirit's boisterous and ambivalent nature, the real transgression came during a stormy season sometime between the 300-500 salek ( #translation for year), a terrifyingly powerful cyclone would raging through Wadiwaya. The wind spirit, fearful of losing the mangrove forest, where they would play almost exclusively driving away people and animals, violated the cycle of life and death. Plunging into the storm, the spirit reversed its rotation and destabilized the eye thus saving the forest. However, the storm would have given back to life in the soil and waters of Wadiwaya; \____ had violated this cycle. 

(SPACE OPEN HERE FOR LIKE WHICH WADI WITNESSED THIS VIOLATION OF THE NATURAL ORDER AND BESEECHED ASYAM TO SLAP \____ INTO THE NETHER REALM (not literally, but would be cool to have some Wadi literally banished to the nether or be of the nether/end.)) 

Asyam, taking offense at this wadi's earthly obsessions taking priority above the natural balance of power, punished the Wadi with a new form. Asyam sucked in the wadi into his mouth and blew into a pile of dead leaves. The leaves absorbed the weakened \____ and, springing from these leaves sprouted a dense network of branches whose gestalt coalesced into \____ (false shepherd) mist-bound form. They say that remnants of \____ (dancer on the wind), able to hide from Asyam by leaving the mangroves for the rainforest, follow \____ creating the mist and characteristic sounds of violently shaken mangrove leaves Perhaps it is (SPACE OPEN FOR WADI????) taking eternal revenge for disrupting their greatest cyclone. No one is quite sure why the mist follows \____ foreboding frame.


SCP level: Euclid :P


#### Modern accounts

[[Story Idea 2 |In adikathu village]], many villagers were lost to the mist spirit after the village shaman rid of the idoloclasts using \____ ("false shepherd") to guide them to their doom. Their bodies were found in the following months in remnants among the roots and soil that constitute the mangrove forest.  

Generally, those who are unfortunate enough to encounter \___ will first hear the rustling of mangrove leaves. Hypnotized, they will follow this sound into the mist, treading into thicker and thicker fog until they cannot even see their own hands out in from of them. The victims will invariably drown or be eaten in the waters of the mangrove forests. Those who do not reside next to a mangrove forest have no reason to worry about \____ for they are still in love even after losing the ability to dance about their beloved forest.

#dispelling

Shamans have found methods of appeasing as well as warding off this ominous spirit. Given an offering of fresh mangrove leaves, the young shoots of a golden leather fern, and the seed oil of the local mangrove trees will keep the spirit at bay even within the mist. While the seed oil will last, leaves and shoots must be replaced within 1 week.

If such measures are not available, burning incense made from mangrove bark or even the bark itself within a hearth will ward off the spirit, but will enrage the spirit. Thus, it is not recommended unless the village is in dire need of protection. Furthermore, the protection is not village-wide; if you cannot smell the burning of the mangrove wood, you are too far away, and will be led toward a watery grave
