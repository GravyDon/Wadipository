Things to note: This is an unfinished and unpolished screenplay. As such, it needs to be given some work.

Eco-terrorist propaganda on the proper relations between man and nature. Conflict between outsiders ensues when they disrespect nature; kidnapping, ritual sacrifice to appease spirits, and securing of borders against foreigners who would disrespect our ancient customs. Also, could describe conquering land on the basis of saving natural resources. 

Purification ritual with perfume (regeneration splash potion thrown around the audience.) followed by an explanation of the morals of the play in an invocation. 

Summarization of Critique: 

- Needs more narration (3rd person commentary on the characters)
    

List of words to be replaced (Ctrl+f these pleased for those who are more familiar with the Wadiwayan vernacular/linguistics):

- Deity
    
-  Involved in turning foreigner into a wangosngos/mosquito (see note below)
    
- FriendName
    
- ProtagName
    
- Address for the audience
    
- Name of the story
    
- Name of village (or the setting which could very well be the capitol considering the story is set near Asi Bay)
    
- Warrior (figured having a name for this would be better than just warrior)
    

  

Missing narrative components:

- What is the nature of the curse that turns the foreigner into mosquito? How does this spread to his kinsmen/people from his birthplace? How will this factor into future RP wars, if at all?
    
- What does the foreigner look like? Should they be inspired based on an actual country within the vicinity of Wadiwaya OR just a generic description of a white settler?
    
- What do the two brothers look like; mainly what attire are they wearing.

Character Descriptions:

Pure, virtuous Wadiwayan that is the protagonist of the story. Son of a fishing legend, who is proud of his heritage as a Wadiwayan fisherman. While still naive, their heart is pure and strong: filled with pride at the wondrous community of which he is a part. Respectful of tradition, in praying at shrines, dancing with friends in spirit festivals, and always wearing the most colorful outfits to constantly please the spirits of Wadiwaya. Everyday, he goes out to carry on the family tradition, until one day he spots smoke coming over the horizon. Good with a fishing rod in a fight.

  

Childhood friend of the protagonist who is a little more timid and not decisive (qualities for facilitating a dialectic to situationally explain the ideals of the protagonist to a fellow Wadiwayan). Now the protagonist isn’t so lonely :). Son of a charcoal maker; sturdy and good with a shovel. 

  

Evil foreigner that destroys the rainforest >:{

- Eats beef and lamb like a disgusting creature
    
- Does not respect and takes offerings from shrines
    
- Flattens the land, burns down a rainforest
    
- Slain by a Wadiwayan, transforms into a mosquito (wangosngos) demon. (“white devil”)
    

  

An angry rainforest god that enacts vengeance upon all that desecrate the rainforest by cursing the people of the Southeast.

Outline of the Screenplay #1: 

`Cut to a normal day in Wadiwaya: the birds are singing, there is laughter and cheery voices permeating the air, colors of all sorts wave through the air on robes, flags, and kites. A group of three Wadiwayan scouts sit in their tower observing it all, sharing a potion of speed.` 

`The first scout, {name for swift winds}, is the fastest of the three, with MAD skills with the bow to boot. Confident, outspoken, and the leader of the group. However, he is prone to being too hasty and getting the group into trouble. Mover and shaker of the group.` 

`The second scout, {name for earth seer}, is a fairly athletic build with more of a passion for caving and exploring mountainous regions. Her motivation for becoming a scout was to go abroad and see the world so that he may report on all of its wonderful geography; alas, she is currently stuck within the job of protecting his village from approaching dangers. Competent with bow and sword. Perhaps useful in an ambush; useful in the end for part of the resolution involving scouting the neighboring borders.` 

`The third scout, {name for dust biter}, is a green recruit with average build and a reputation for laziness. He doesn’t aspire to become good at his job and is likely, like with his previous assignments, to drift into another role. However, he enjoys the company of his friends and is generally willing to do the tasks that the other scouts are too preoccupied to do. Essentially, he is the token character to do all the boring shit or fuck up the cool shit.` 

`On ice for now… Not a good start :(`

Outline of Screenplay #2.1:

Need to include following elements (feel free to add to this list): 

Exposition: A year into the arrival of the People of the Comet In the Southern Rainforests (UNFINISHED EXPOSITION)

#Scene #0: Narrator on the stage with whole cast standing in silence with splash potions of blindness

Narrator: Asyam Asyam, good people of Wadiwaya! Today, you will witness a tale recounting the blessing of {Deity}; a tale filled withed with harrowing feats of bravery against those who would pillage our bountiful rainforests and in turn undermine our way of life. Two boys, brave and true, regular Wadiwayans, go forth into the fray and, with their faith resting upon the honorable {Deity}, colonizers were driven from this land once and for all. The hope of these esteemed actors here is that you, the audience, will come away from this spectacle with a newfound respect for the grace and power dwelling within the roots of this land. Perhaps you too may find yourself in collusion or even conflict with the spirits and Wadi, so let this tale remind you of their frightening power and influence. {Address for the audience}, it is an honor to present to you the tale of {Name of the story}.



#Scene #1: Two boys out in the Asi bay: one a fisherman and the other his friend who is a generational charcoal maker. 

Narrator: We begin our tale in the crystal clear waters of the Asi bay where two young boys spend their day together; fate weaves its web though with signs on the horizon soon to pull these unwitting boys into the fabric of Wadiwayan history.

Friend: Aahhhh! A perfect day for a swim, don’tcha think!?

Protagonist: Quit with that. I’ve already told you that you could only come out with me if you promised to help. 

Friend: Come off it, {ProtagName}! You’re working too much, even though we’re still as free as ever! Don’t you ever want to -

Protagonist: - carry forward my father’s legacy? Yes, yes I do.

Friend: Ugh… But just look at the water! We probably have the clearest, most stunning waters on this side of the Bay, and yet you would rather sit in this canoe. 

Protagonist: Yeah, how else am I going to fish? If only I could walk on water like the beautiful {}. Perhaps I wouldn’t even have to use a rod; I could just exist, and the fish would be stunned by my beauty!

Friend: Pshhhh! You, stunning ANYONE with that face? You’ve been eating too many {insert psychedelic mushroom or plant native to Southeast Asia} during our spirit dances, haven’t you!

Protagonist: You’re one to talk. Last time I remember, YOU were the one who -

Friend: Aaaaahhh laaaaa laaa laaaaaaaaaaa! I don’t want to hear that (rocks the boat; probably just make your character spaz out for this part)!

Protagonist: Bro! Chill I’m just playing. Jeez, this guy: always rocking the boat. 

Friend: Damn you’re corny… Just like your bait!

Protagonist: What is that even supposed to… Hey, wait, do you see that over there? Is that smoke?

Friend: Ummm yeah, that’s… Not in the direction of any charcoal kilns. Is someone starting a brush fire?

Protagonist: Maybe, but it’s not that time of the season for that. A fire in Summer could be a real issue.

Friend: Yeah, you’re right; remember when I was working with my father and didn’t properly load that one kiln? Those fire spirits did a bit of mischief to me on that day! Nearly started a wildfire there! My dad was on my ass for like a week!

Protagonist: Oh yeah, you were a real dummy for that one, lol. So, should we check it out?

Friend: Hey! Ugh well fine… Wouldn’t want anyone thinking that I was screwing up again.

Protagonist: Haha sure! After we put this thing out or just see what’s going on, let’s go for a swim.

Friend: Alright! Come on, let’s get to that smoke so we can swim already!

  

*Both actors start furiously rowing across the wooden stage while the curtains fall and the next set is put into place*

  

Narrator: Without hesitation, the two spirited companions embark to the rainforest surrounding {name of village}, hopeful that their efforts will protect their esteemed village full of loved ones and memories. 

  

#Scene #2: In the jungle; the two characters are trekking towards the source of the smoke. A looming sense of dread hangs in the air as spirits swarm around in chaotic fashion

  

Protagonist: It doesn’t feel right; the air feels thick with… Rage. Confusion.

Friend: Mmmhm; maybe we should go back and get someone else to do this?

Protagonist: Are you serious!? Come on, when are you going to get over your fear of spirits? They aren’t here to hurt us; we’ve been existing with them for centuries.

Friend: Come on, dude, you can’t deny that this is not normal. We don’t encounter this… Feeling every day. It feels like I’m being pressed from all sides; if we go further, I don’t know where my mind is going to go to.

Protagonist: Oh please! You’ve been reading too many folk stories. Possessions haven’t happened in Wadiwayan history since the great collapse, which isn’t even to speak about our quiet village. Possessions don’t happen around here.

Friend: Right, right. But what about-

Protagonist: Shhhh! Look…

Narrator: Happening upon the camp of a strangely dressed, pale man, the spirits, disturbed from their natural cycles through the presence of the interloper, intensely mirage the camp in a thick fog of stagnation and general unease. 

  

*Man throws his trash and the ground and burns it up next to his campfire. Tall, and clad in a leather jerkin, boots, and gloves, a spectacled man looms within his camp. Whittling away at a piece of wood, idly passing the time as his meal cooks over the flames.*

  

Narrator: as the pale man’s rubbish burns in the flames, the spirits swirl in expectant judgement; crimes against the rainforest being recorded on the polluted winds drifting up and into the forest canopy. 

Friend: That’s-

Protagonist: *hits his friend with an open fist* Be quiet *said in a whisper*


*The man pulls off a slab of filthy beef from the stick that roasts over the fire. Munching into the beef LOUDLY, the two Wadiwayans look with mild disgust at the sacrilegious display. Clearly, if they had any doubts that this man was a foreigner, now they were certain of this man as an anomaly*


Friend: Oh my god, that’s disgusting. Can he chew any louder, maybe we don’t have to whisper with his disgusting chewing.

Protagonist: Pshhh! Hey now’s not the time for jokes, {FriendName}... We should attack.

Friend: What!? Are you possessed? Let’s not make jokes, right? Come on please tell me that you’re joking.

Narrator: as the two boys stared at each other with opposing intent, the air coagulates around them with frightening responsivity to their collective panic. Clearly, they happened upon a breath of forest not meant for the weak.

Protagonist: Fine! Let’s go for now, but we need to come back.

Friend: Of course. We should go back to the village and get the {name for warrior} involved.

Narrator: Happening upon this strange man’s camp, the two boys wonder at the strange sense of doom pervading this situation. Little did they know that such an individual was an existential threat to the very lifeline of the Wadiwayans: nature itself. Spirits could only merely allude to the great danger staring them dead in the face. Knowing that their efforts towards a resolution require more preparation, the two friends make the return journey.


*The two slink away into the brush, with the grace expected of the Wadiwayan people. Barely a rustle is heard over their retreat.*

Scene #3: Still in the jungle; the man character is nowhere to be seen on the set. Maybe he could disappear through a trapdoor or something. 

NOTE: Discuss the plans for getting the foreigner out of the forest and into the hands of authorities. Clearly, the spiritual vibes are sending out signals so, in their desperation to find an answer to this problem, the two boys pray at a shrine where they receive and audience with a powerful deity who gifts them with an arrow. None of the characters know how to shoot a bow though…

Scene #4: Out by the bay again, the boys regroup after what they just saw. Needing some relaxation time, the two discuss their next steps.  

NOTE: Seeing as it is almost about to get dark, the two part promising to meet the Protagonist’s friend in front of the charcoal kilns or essentially the Friend’s house. They resolve to use the arrow to stab the foreigner, not exactly knowing what the arrow does. To do so, they devise a plan to use a fishing rod to pull the foreigner close, throwing them off balance, and then the friend stabbing them with an arrow. However, during the course of this conversation, the friend gets cold feet; the protagonist really lays down the law as to why they should do this a soon as they can. Personal reasons are also involved, with both wanting to get the glory for protecting their village in accordance with the deity which petitioned them. Before they leave, they fantasize about all the rewards they will receive upon their victory, thus lulling them into a nice stupor in which they fall asleep. 


Scene #5: In the Jungle again, slinking towards the camp that was previously setup by the mysterious foreigner. 
  
NOTE: Have a fight scene which starts after the two track down the man (he isn’t at his old camp, but he clumsily left tracks in the mud and through the branches of trees he snapped in his wake. Could be an ambush or a genuine fight with some choreography; up to the discretion of the actors who want to play out this scene, since this will be the hardest scene to execute. 

Once stabbed with the arrow, the god manifests and curses the whole bloodline that is in contact with the arrowhead. The man gasps in pain as he falls to the ground and dies (maybe people could throw splash potions of damaging at him for fun at this point to “simulate” the curse claiming its first victim). The two boys stand in awe as the deity postures, thanking them for their service and granting them with their reward…. I don’t fucking know, but maybe it’s something that is sooooo distinctive, that the rest of the village will know what it means such that their accomplishments will be acknowledged. 


Scene #6: In the village, surrounded by extras, cheering on the two victors for their brave deeds

I figure that this part can just be a dance party over a song (on a minecraft jukebox) where the narrator wraps up the story with a nice little bow. All is well that ends well; down with the Punjaja! Do not threaten our peace and our way of life anymore! Let even the children be capable of striking down evil within our midst without fear or shame, for we are Wadiwaya!
