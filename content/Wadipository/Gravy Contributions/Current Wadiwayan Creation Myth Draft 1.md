"Ayuyuwana is born from a coconut floating in the primeval ocean. she splits it into the sea and the sky. Asyam manifests into existence. all of the natural world emanates from Asyam. Ayuyuwana begins cultivating coincidence into rainforests, coral reefs, spirits and humans. humans come from her spitting rambutan seeds into the sand—symbolizing the cyclical nature of life, death, and rebirth."

As the coconut, containing the qualia and spiritual essence of the Wadi people and land, was split open in the waves of the ancient Asi sea, Ayuyuwana and Ingra were born. Ayuyuwana, born of the coconut milk, adored life in all of its manifestations and sought to create life within the world within her own image. In her budding consciousness, Ayuyuwana splits the shell of the coconut with her hairpin and Inadvertently splits the ancient ocean in two. As one side of the split rises up into the sky, the land is exposed with the receding ocean. Inggra, the protector of this great power latent within Ayuyuwana, or the power of life and dis-equilibration, chooses to protect this new form of the sacred coconut milk just as they always have. Diving into the sea, Inggra starts their search for the secrets of the ocean as Ayuyuwana chooses to explore the land. 

As these two scour the new landscape for their spontaneous purposes, an equal and opposite entropic conformation takes hold of the Universe. Just as the phase of the coconut goes from intact to broken, the multiplicity of states in the Universe nucleates around this event to create a similar entity. Asyam, the god of coincidence (or entropy maaaybe), manifests into existence. Seeing these two aberrations making wanton fun of terraforming the Earth to their whims, Asyam adopts an air of caution seeing it best not to go forward without ascertaining the nature of these new gods. A three body system soon to fall into chaos.

Rushing to land, far away from her birth place, Ayuyuwana rides the incoming tsunami onto land once populated by the other half of the primeval ocean. This was ancient Wadiwaya: desolate, barren, and covered in sea foliage and dead fish not spirited into the sky. As the sea settled around this Wadiwaya, Ayuyuwana contemplated what her first garden would look like. With a flash of inspiration, Ayuyuwana takes these primitive forms of life into her mouth so that she may impart her gift upon them: consciousness (perhaps this could be a point of contention between Asyam and Ayuyuwana which is spreading consciousness to lifeforms without proper consultation of how this effects the cosmic balance; however, life is necessarily an imbalance or away from equilibrium, so it's in character for a god of life/gardening). Spitting out the matter, shaped into what are now known as rambutan seeds, Ayuyuwana sowed the land of Wadiwaya with sacred seeds. Still not satisfied with her work, seeing as her new subjects would need a suitable kingdom to serve her, Ayuyuwana called out to Inggra to deliver her life within the sea so that she may drag it onto land. 

===============================================================
 "Inggra goes oystering. he randomly creates the sun, moon, and stars by entrapping a whaleshark demon in an oyster"
 
Earlier, upon the birth of Ayuyuwana, Inggra manifested his self into a (I forgor what they looked like). Diving deep, Inggra, filled with suspicion at this hostile world and apprehension at the sudden change to Ayuyuwana, made way for the sea bed in hopes of finding weaponry. Using his strength, Inggra parted the sea floor in search of material for a weapon. Scouring quickly, creating small explosions in the water as he rocketed along the sea floor, Inggra turned his gaze upward to sea a giant blot in his view: a distortion moving across the surface projecting rays of light in a multicolored corona. Curious, Inggra approached to find that this distortion was in fact a whaleshark, but not just any whaleshark. This whaleshark, during the primeval times of the Earth, accrued enough energy to gain a consciousness. Being seen as one of the great kings of the ancient sea, many creatures left this whaleshark alone or even payed tribute in their approach. However, Inggra, in his ignorance, simply treated this encounter as a simple exploration rather than a cordial employ of the esteemed whaleshark's audience. 

"Who dares approach me, and from my underside! You are one insolent wretch!" The Whaleshark boomed.

Inggra, seeing no real threat to this false idol simply stated, "It is I, Inggra, your new god. Who are you? What are you? Tell me-"

"Don't order me around, Inggra! Clearly, you have no idea of my status or even where you are, do you? Well, let me start by announcing my esteem for I am Syurapetri (or whatever name we go with): demon of the seas and eater of light." As he says this, he rolls around showing off his back filled within all colorful gems of all shapes and sizes. "I shall excuse this transgression of yours if you simply bring me another gem."

Inggra scowls at this display; such gaudiness and lack of interest in Inggra. How could such a brute exist for so long? However, deft in spotting weakness, Inggra swells in delight in seeing one flaw too big to miss: complacency. "Oh why certainly, oh great Syurapetri. Forgive me for, while I do have my own authority on the surface, clearly you are the ruler of these depths. What gem would you desire for your prestigious collection?"

Falling for it, hook, line, and sinker, the Whaleshark blubs in glee, "A pearl! Not just any pearl though; the pearls from an oyster demon off to the far North. It's been millennia since I've made the trip and I'm hungering for their dazzling light. In fact, don't come back till you find me a pearl the size of which can only be found within (name for an oyster demon? Maybe the moon or the second moon could be found within this oyster?). You will know of their presence; they produce a bubble column that can be seen from miles away." 

Without weapons, Inggra hesitates to accept such an unreasonable and costly assignment for he must make to the East for Ayuyuwana soon, but, seeing as this Whaleshark has existed for millennia, gaining the Whaleshark's cooperation might make the seas more manageable for both Inggra and Ayuyuwana. Additionally, perhaps this oyster may be of service in ridding this whaleshark from *his* oceans. "Give me a weapon then and I will find you a gem the size of your head. After all, how am I to steal from another being comparable to your strength?" Inggra states plainly so as not to betray the leading nature of the question.

"Paha! That shell of a demon! He could drape me in bubbles for all I care! I could easily get the gem myself, but traveling that far is not within my interests, but you seem to be quite agile. Getting that gem shouldn't be any issue for someone of your caliber even without a weapon." The whaleshark pauses for a moment in contemplation. "However, I shall grant you the material for a weapon or at least the location of said material." 

Inggra, clearly not dealing with a completely naïve brute, reluctantly accepts to retrieve the oyster. In return, the Whaleshark speaks of a rift in the ocean to the northwest. From this rift, an island of great mass formed long ago even so that the full height of the primal sea could not hide it. Within that island is obsidian: a black, glass-like material sharper than the winds of the North sea. 

"Then I am off! I shall have your gem to you before long, great Syurapetri." with an ingratiating flourish, Inggra returned the stupid grin of the great Whaleshark. Inggra's plan was going smoothly so far; now he just needed to get close enough to turn the balance of power. "Good wishes my faithful, Inggra. Be at peace." the blaspheme Syurapetri said without the slightest clue into the origins or status of Inggra: completely centered on his own light. Now is not the time for those considerations though; Inggra heard the call of Ayuyuwana and makes way for new, Eastern land. (I'm ending this part here since I would like to make the story of Inggra accidentally making the sun and the moon *after* meeting Asyam with Asyam laying some ground rules to be violated.)

==============================================================

(Gonna cut it here for now. Might flesh this out more later or anyone else can take a shot at this scene between Inggra and Ayuyuwana interacting.)

"Asyam takes offense because proper respects aren't given to them. they threaten to destroy all of reality with two great eclipses-the gongs they wear as earrings"

(I figure before this part, seeing as Asyam needs to introduce their self, having a dialogue between the three gods before chaos ensues, and ultimately as the seed for conflict, is necessary. Also, Asyam can be described from the perspective of Ayuyuwana or Inggra or even have a monologue moment regaling his holy form in contrast to the new god's derivative design (from Asyam's perspective). The gongs, and perhaps other character design choices, can reflect the state of the world. In fact, perhaps Asyam only manifested because of the manifestation of other gods who constitute the world too; Other design choices, like a cosmic robe which represents the skies, or perhaps accessories such as a staff which shows his mastery in understanding and working with reality, might be pertinent design choices to motivate more character conflict or flesh it out.)

"The spirits of Ayuyuwana's parasol and the nature spirits of Asyam go to war."
(Dope idea I'm just wondering where the spirits from the parasol come from. Could be a cool event to base human history in considering that the spirits interact with the psychology of the Wadi people. Maybe like this is the origin of most evil spirits?)

"Inggra strikes Asyam down from the sky with his great flyswatter."
(Inggra forging an obsidian fly swatter might be funny. Maybe they can also make an enchanting table with the obsidian which completely blows Asyam out of the water in their fight. Otherwise, I'm wondering about the balance of power between the two characters. It's fine if Asyam is physically weak and is instead exercises power through metaphysical structures which hold up reality; then the fight needs to conclude with Inggra realizing his mistake and forging the cosmic harmony between the three that is necessary for continued existence.)

"The world begins to die without Asyam. Ayuyuwana and Inggra make an agreement with Asyam to give each other proper respect and create a cosmic harmony that all must follow"
(Refer to last note.)

Cool. Bye!
