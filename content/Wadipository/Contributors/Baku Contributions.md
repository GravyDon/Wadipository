 Known as lingkunagi, a Wadiwayan themed card game inspired by Ganjifa. The gist of the game is the sequential playing of cards in accordance with an initial rule set by the starter of a trick (determined based on the lowest rank card, the orange Dungtangan diamond). The winner of a trick is determined based upon the highest rank card played within a trick. A trick ends either by the completion of a cycle OR through the intentional breaking of a trick.
