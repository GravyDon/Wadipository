#### Vocabulary

> [!NOTE] #### Wadiwayan Calendar VERSION 1
> "1 month (kusha "spoke") = 1 irl day 
> 1 year (salek "wheel") = 9 days (turning of the wheel coincides with the in-lore wiparadya, which does not have to correspond to the IRL one) 
> ##### Epochal Dates:
> - 53 years: 53 ya - 0 ya = ES (ehesyam "nine rains"), 
> - arrival of foreigners in Abexilas 307 years: 360 ya - 53 ya = TY (atyalokyana "restoration"),
> - period of cultural reform in Wadiwaya, Lampung-Lailan made the new capital from the old city \[tbd\] 2142 years: 2502 ya - 360 ya = AY (ayuyunga "blooming"), 
> - foundation of Wadiwaya as a nation, return of Ayuyuwana as the ruler of Wadiwaya 6498 years: 9000 ya - 2502 ya = BS (besaelunga "make-knowing"), believed creation of the world"

> [!NOTE] #### Wadiwayan Calendar VERSION 2
> "calendar - handek-handekan 73 fiveday weeks, final day being market day (ganuk-ganukan) 9 months of mostly 8 weeks, 9th month having a few extra days which mark the tyotÃ©rahu(?) four-year cycle called kusya (wheel) dates are named in DMY order, with the name of each rather than numbers each day, month, and year has numbers assigned to them. 
> 
> days skip even numbers, months skip odd numbers, and years are simply 1-4. 
> 
> Thus the calendar is like this: 
> days: 1 - 1, 2 - 3, 3- 5, 4 - 7, 5 - 9 (???)
> months: 1 - 2, 2 - 4, 3 - 6, 4 - 8, 5 - 10, 6 - 12, 7 - 14, 8 - 16, 9 - 18 (???)
> years: 1, 2, 3, 4 
> #Divination **the numbers are added together by wanyong to divine the auspicious and unfortunate days, i.e. when events of great fortune and misery respectively are to occur**"

NOTE: Version 2 contradicts or disregards version 1 vocab and structure.

NOTE: Ghost days or leap year have been proposed for solving the non-integer solar year in terms of days.
